                                <p>Technology has profoundly shaped human production, consumption, and interaction with food. From the domestication of fire to the development of artificial intelligence, technological advancements have continually revolutionized our relationship with food. In my unessay, I explore the history of food technology and how it has evolved from hundreds of thousands of years ago to today.</p>
                                <p>At the centerpiece of my unessay is a recipe search engine which I developed in the Python programming language. The recipe engine takes as input a list of ingredients and outputs the most relevant recipes that you can follow if you have those ingredients. The recipes have been scraped from professional, Italian cook Laura Vitale’s website. I implemented well-known machine learning and natural language processing techniques to match the output recipes with the input ingredients most accurately. I have provided a brief, more technical description of the recipe engine here. My recipe engine reflects the technological evolution of food and how human interaction with food continues to develop. Advancements in computing, internet connectivity, and data processing have unlocked new ways to share and discover recipes. The engine demonstrates the high availability of culturally diverse recipes as it supports over one thousand unique Laura Vitale recipes. Further, the engine makes consumption easier as it helps you answer the question: what breakfast/lunch/dinner/snack can I make now with what I have? Finally, the recipe engine demonstrates how we can continue to leverage new technology, such as machine learning, to enhance our food experiences.</p>
                                <p>As part of my unessay, I researched multiple technologies that have shaped or are shaping human consumption, production, and interaction with food. Below is my brief yet comprehensive timeline of such technologies, beginning with fire and ending with artificial intelligence.</p>
